# CUDA Merge Sort and Search 
The project implements sorting and searching algorithms using CUDA technology for parallel processing on NVIDIA graphics cards. The main functions of the program include:
* Merge Sort: Parallel implementation of the merge sort algorithm.
* Binary Search: Parallel implementation of the binary search algorithm.
* Linear Search: Parallel implementation of the linear search algorithm.
* Mathematical Operations: Maclaurin series computations.
* Reverse Sort: Sorting in reverse order.

All of the above-mentioned algorithms have been implemented on both GPU and CPU to compare their execution times and determine whether implementing them with CUDA is worthwhile or if sequential execution on the CPU is sufficient. The project was carried out by a team of 3 people.
